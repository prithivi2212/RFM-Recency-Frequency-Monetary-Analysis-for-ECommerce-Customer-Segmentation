# RFM-Recency-Frequency-Monetary-Analysis-for-ECommerce-Customer-Segmentation

This project focuses on applying RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to an e-commerce customer dataset to identify key segments for personalized marketing. Using Python, SQL, and Excel, the dataset was cleaned, processed, and segmented to uncover patterns in customer behavior. Feature engineering enabled the creation of RFM scores that helped classify customers into meaningful groups such as high-value, at-risk, and churn-prone. These insights were then used to tailor marketing campaigns that resulted in a 25% increase in conversion rates and a 10% improvement in retention among at-risk customers. The project also contributed to a 15% rise in Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) within the first quarter post-implementation by aligning promotions with customer segments. Additionally, marketing resources were reallocated based on RFM-driven segmentation, ensuring higher ROI and strategic customer engagement. This project demonstrates the business impact of customer analytics and behavioral segmentation, highlighting the value of data-driven decision-making in digital commerce.
